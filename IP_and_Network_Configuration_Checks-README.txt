This script performs a network security audit on your server. It checks your serverâ€™s IP addresses (both public and private), ensures that SSH is not exposed on public IPs, and verifies that a firewall is active and correctly configured.

Features:
IP Type Identification: Identifies whether an IP address is public or private.

SSH Exposure Check: Verifies if the SSH service is exposed to public IPs and ensures that the exposure is intentional.

Firewall Status: Verifies that the firewall (UFW or iptables) is active and correctly configured.

Prerequisites:
A Linux-based system.

Root or sudo privileges to modify system configurations.

The tools ufw, iptables, and ss should be available on the system.

How to Use the Script:
1. Clone or   the Script:
Save the script to a file, for example, network_security_audit.sh.

2. Make the Script Executable:
In your terminal, navigate to the directory where the script is saved and run the following command to make it executable:

 
 
chmod +x network_security_audit.sh
3. Run the Script:
To start the network security audit and hardening process, run the script:

 
 
sudo ./network_security_audit.sh
The script will check the status of various network security configurations and apply hardening measures. Make sure to run the script with sudo to ensure it has the necessary permissions to modify system configurations.

4. Exit the Script:
If you need to stop the script during execution, press CTRL+C in the terminal.

Example Output:
 
 
Starting security audit and hardening process...

IP addresses assigned to this server:
192.168.1.100 is a private IP address.
203.0.113.50 is a public IP address.

Checking if SSH service is exposed on public IPs...
SSH is exposed on public IP: 203.0.113.50. Ensure this is intentional.

Verifying Firewall Status...
UFW firewall is active.

Security audit and hardening process completed!
Calling Individual Parts of the Script
If you want to execute individual sections of the script, you can call specific functions. Below are examples of how to execute each part separately.

1. Check IP Addresses (Public vs. Private):
To gather and check whether your server's IP addresses are public or private, create a script that calls the gather_ip_addresses function:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
# Gather IP addresses and check if they are public or private
gather_ip_addresses
Usage:

 
 
sudo ./gather_ip_addresses.sh
2. Check SSH Exposure to Public IPs:
To check if SSH is exposed to public IPs, create a script that calls the check_ssh_exposure function:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
# Check SSH exposure
check_ssh_exposure
Usage:

 
 
sudo ./check_ssh_exposure.sh
3. Verify Firewall Status:
To verify if a firewall (UFW or iptables) is active and properly configured, create a script that calls the verify_firewall function:

 
 
#!/bin/ 
# Verify firewall status
verify_firewall
Usage:

 
 
sudo ./verify_firewall.sh
Notes:
Root Privileges: The script must be run with root or sudo privileges to perform the necessary checks and changes.

Firewall Configuration: The script checks if UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall) is installed and active. If not, it checks if iptables is running and ensures that the firewall is correctly configured.

SSH Exposure: The script checks if the SSH service (port 22) is exposed on public IPs. If it's exposed on a public IP, it will provide a warning to ensure this exposure is intentional.

Network Interface: The script automatically checks the IP addresses assigned to the system using hostname -I and verifies each IP.
